# Yoghurt Demand Dataset

## Overview
This dataset (`data_yoghurt.csv`) contains information on yoghurt sales across multiple U.S. cities and time periods.  
It is designed for exercises in **demand estimation** and **counterfactual simulation**, such as analyzing market shares, estimating discrete-choice demand models (e.g. logit or nested logit), and evaluating the welfare effects of mergers.

- Markets are defined at the **cityâ€“period** level.
- In each market, between **1 and 5 products** are available.
- The dataset will be used to study the welfare implications of the proposed merger between **Chobani** and **Dannon**.

## Source
