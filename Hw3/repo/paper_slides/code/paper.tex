\section{Question 1}

When the model is correctly specified, the only source of price endogeneity is 
the correlation between prices $p_{jct}$ and unobserved demand shocks $\xi_{jct}$. 
Both sets of instruments, cost shifters and competitor based variables satisfy the two IV conditions:

\textbf{(i) Relevance:}
Each instrument must be correlated with prices, 
$\operatorname{Cov}(Z_{jct},p_{jct})\neq 0$. 
Cost shifters (e.g., distance$\times$density) affect prices through marginal costs,
while competitor-based instruments (e.g., number of products in the market)
affect prices through competition intensity.

\textbf{(ii) Exclusion restriction:}
In the correctly specified model, neither set of instruments affects 
utility directly or correlates with demand shocks,
$\operatorname{Cov}(Z_{jct},\xi_{jct})=0$.
Therefore, both types of instruments can deliver an unbiased estimate of 
the true price coefficient $\alpha$.

\section{Question 2}

When the model is misspecified, included instruments (based on competitors'
characteristics, e.g.\ the number of products in a market) can bias the
estimated own price elasticity because they shift market shares through two
channels: (i) indirectly via prices and (ii) directly through the demand
system's substitution structure.  The exclusion restriction for such
instruments is valid only under the maintained demand model once we have
correctly controlled for the instrument's direct effect on shares.  If
the model is misspecified (e.g.\ logit is imposed but true substitution
violates IIA), the direct share effect is not properly absorbed, so the
instrument is correlated with the structural error and IV estimates of
$\alpha$ are biased.

By contrast, excluded instruments (cost shifters such as
distance$\times$disease prices to distribution centers) affect demand only
through prices.  Under this question, costs have no direct impact on utilities or market shares, so the exclusion restriction $\Cov(Z^{\text{cost}},\xi)=0$ remains valid even if the demand model is
misspecified, provided that misspecification does not introduce a direct
non price path from the cost shifter to shares.

Because excluded and included variables may be correlated, it is important to
residualize the cost instrument with respect to the included controls:
$\tilde Z=Z-(X'X)^{-1}X'Z$.  This orthogonalization removes the variation in
$Z$ that is mechanically related to included covariates, reducing spurious
correlation with the error term and making the IV estimate of $\alpha$ more
robust when there is a risk of misspecification.

\section{Question 3}

See ``Hw3/repo/analysis/code/q3\_strong\_excluded\_instrument.py" for the code.

The included instrument is a function of the composition itself (e.g., the
number of products in the market), i.e.\ it is measurable with respect to
$\mathcal J_{ct}$. Residualizing it on $(\mathcal J_{ct},j,c,m)$ collapses its
variation to zero and destroys relevance. 

Table XXX reports the value of instrument in city 1 period 4.
